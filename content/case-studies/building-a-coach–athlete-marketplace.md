summary: >-
  Great Design has become a differentiator for many startups looking to receive
  early funding. In fact, hiring a noted design leader can set such startups
  apart from their competitors. Being able to demonstrate a complete, powerful
  and delightful experience for CoachList was a key factor in receiving their
  first $2 Million.
case_study:
  impact: |-
    * Designs helped launch a company.
    * Designs were used to acquire $2M in funding.
    * Formed the basis not just for an app, but for a complete market ecosystem.
  problem: >-
    * Research showed there was an unmet need for aggregating coaches and
    trainers in what is today a cottage industry.

    * There was no initial funding.

    * A previous rough design had received little traction
  solution: >-
    * Research with coaches, athletes and camps.

    * Defined initial requirements and screens.

    * Ended up designing ~ 200 screens, including landing pages, consumer review
    pages, profile pages, booking and checkout pages, messaging pages,
    dashboards, social and more.

A few months before starting to design this app, I had helped the CEO of a different startup radically improve the experience of his vacation rental app. This effort helped him get his company acquired. As a result, he asked me to help with his next venture— Coachlist.com.

I designed the logo, created a visual design, and designed hundreds of pages. Here is just the  homepage, designed to support multiple entry points and calls to action. Note that every page was designed for responsive as well (anything below 1080w was responsive, and we designed every page to support devices with a screen as narrow as 320w).
