image_caption: Description of How Easy It is to Get Highly Relevant Candidates
summary: >-
  Becoming relevant in any industry requires that a company provide a laser
  focus on unmet user needs that customers are willing to pay for. Our user
  research and design highlighted these unmet needs and helped the company pivot
  to focus on revenue-generating activities.
case_study:
  impact: >-
    * Research helped redefine their roadmap (to introduce Sort by Relevance
    earlier), so customers could find just enough highly qualified candidates
    rapidly.

    * Helped this company find their niche in a very crowded marketplace, so
    they could move from last to #3 in their area of focus.

    * Improved ease of use and engagement through the funnel so 91% of reviewers
    now list ease of use as a key reason they like the software.

    * We were asked to educate their in-house visual design team on how to
    produce exceptional VisD, and to train their teams on our Design Thinking
    processes.
  problem: >-
    * A recruiting company had built an app, trying to compete with
    ZipRecruiter.

    * They were seeing a high number of unique visitors, but low engagement and
    conversion.

    * Once customers converted, many dropped off within a month of signing up.

    * Their UX and Product Management teams did not know how to solve this
    challenge.
  solution: >-
    * Conducted research, which showed customers did not want their job posted
    to hundreds of job sites (which was the site’s call to action) or to receive
    thousands of resumes. They wanted few, very qualified candidates.

    * Conducted a Rapid Design Lab to clarify the user journeys based on
    research, created a new set of CTAs and simplified the marketing funnel.

    * Though they had an in-house UX team, my team redesigned the entire app,
    including Marketing pages and the engagement funnel.

When we started this project, the CMO told us she needed someone who her VP of UX could learn from, in order to help the team design experiences that differentated. The company had a 12-person UX team and had invested in marketing to drive people to their site. Their initial acquisition funnel looked OK, in that a sufficient number of users signed up for a free trial. However, most dropped off the free trial before paying a subscription fee for the product.

We conducted qualitative user research and identified several key insights:

* Their call-to-action, which was “Post your job to 100s of job sites with a single click” initially sounded good to recruiters. However, they received at times thousands of resumes, 90% of which were from completely unqualified candidates. Instead, they wanted maybe 50 to 100 resumes from highly qualified candidates.
* Companies in the range of 30 - 100 employees would use this sort of tool.
* Companies ranging from 100 - 400 employees might use this tool, if it could integrate well with their existing Applicant Tracking System (ATS)

Our more quantitative research found that:

* The existing calls to action on the marketing page were confusing
* Over 90% of users were not able to do the work that would have helped them attract more qualified candidates, because their acquisition funnel had:
* confusing calls to action
* a lack of focus that overwhelmed them
* an unclear visual hierarchy

One user said “going through this is like \[experiencing] death by a thousand cuts.”

Thus, we helped them redefine their focus and personas, decrease and simplify their calls to action, and we redesigned both the Marketing pages and their acquisition funnel, to gamify it and progressively reveal greater value at the point of need.

We also helped them redefine their roadmap. For example, instead of adding features that existing ATSs already had, they could create an algorighm that would enable them to do automated matching of candidate resumes to open positions, thereby increasing the quality of resumes.

Here are screens that show the new marketing page, signup pages, and landing page to increase the quality of applicants.
