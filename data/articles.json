        "body": "<p>Even if an app is usable and delightful, no matter how well designed, it often doesn’t represent the entirety of a user or customer’s experience with a product or service. Sites and apps themselves are often just parts of the total solution. User Experience teams that can help optimize not just tactical screens in a UI, but also end-to-end experiences, can help increase profitable revenue and customer loyalty. This is what my team and I did with the telephony quick config tool.</p><p>Supporting customer business requirements and curating the UX requires understanding the different users’ journeys, from consideration through adoption or purchase, use, service, and support. Only then can we design and orchestrate the total experience a customer has at every touch point. UX teams think differently, and perceive obstacles and opportunities that other disciplines don’t. Likewise, product managers and engineers perceive obstacles and opportunities that UX does not. None of us can do it ourselves. When any of us gets arrogant and tries to do everything ourselves, it restricts dialog. What we want is open dialog and a recognition that the total experience does matter.</p><p>I have been part of teams that have been #1 in their markets, and part of teams that were on the decline. Teams that either were #1 or who later became #1 always had the same trait in common: Deep respect for and collaboration between one another (Product Management, Engineering and UX). Likewise, teams that were on the decline tended to restrict one another and listen to data that selectively optimized themselves, and not the product or organization. When we all optimize for the team and support one another, it tends to create a more successful product, solution and organization.</p><p>UX tends to introduce Design Thinking processes that focus on experience outcomes. Tim Brown highlights in his book Change by Design how design thinking can transform organizations to produce more profitable revenue, and increase innovation. So, the opportunity for UX is twofold: To design features we are given, and also to ensure we are solving the right challenge.</p><h2>Curating the End-to-end Experience to Open a New Market: Example 1</h2><p>In this first example, my team was asked to design software used to control IP phones. An executive on a cross-business-unit council inited me to participate in meetings where we learned Sales encountered challenges selling IP telephony solutions to small businesses.</p><p>Thus, my team reached out to the field and conducted research to understand these challenges. It turns out that small businesses preferred to purchase complete solutions from resellers (we really did not know this previously). Resellers on the other hand needed to be able to deploy solutions in a couple hours, or they would begin losing margin. The challenge was that it took several days for resellers to deploy our telephony solution, which reduced their profit margin to zero. As a result, resellers chose to sell competitors’ solutions, even though they were less technically capable.</p><p><p>I presented these challenges to a cross-business-unit team of executives, along with two solutions:</p><ul><li>A quick config tool that configured all of the devices in a telephony solution, including a switch, a router, a PC running call control and voicemail software, and much more, then restarted all of the devices in the right order to ensure the solution functioned properly.</li><li>Solution bundles, which decreased purchasing decisions from millions of options to seven (there were 12 routers models with 60 possible software versions, 8 switch models with 80 software versions, and other software with numerous versions, many of which were completely incompatible with one another).</li></ul></p><p>In the end, my team took four people three months to design and build a tool that enabled resellers to set up our end-to-end solution in 15 minutes, instead of two days. It also resulted in $100 Million in sales <em>over</em> our financial goals, in just the first year.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"UX Increasing Revenue by $100 Million over Goal in Year 1\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"6b426466-d2db-4bc0-9300-b5ca5f247f2e\" src=\"/images/Commercial-Voice.jpg\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Simplifying Deployment Increased Revenue by $100 Million Over Goal in the First Year Alone</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p>However, after implementing this solution as a proof-of-concept, no one business unit would own the project and take it to market. As a result, I assembled the hardware and wheeled the solution into our cross-business-unit council of senior executives. I highlighted the challenges, then depicted our new solution. As part of the process, I asked our CMO as the least technically sophisticated person in the room if he would be willing to configure the solution. After some prompting, he did, and within 15 minutes, he had successfully set up a network that enabled him to place phone calls. The result? This executive council agreed to take this product to market. Within two months, it was on the corporate web site.</p><p>The point of this is not that UX solved the whole problem. We had to work cross-functionally, and truly it was a team effort. The point is that by leveraging design thinking in the overall process, we as a team were able to solve much higher-order problems than just designing tactical screens.</p><p>The VP who invited me to the cross-business-unit council and I met several years later at a party, where he said to me: “Jim— we only worked on three projects together, but each of those three was more fun and impactful than any other projects I worked on throughout my career!” That’s a great feeling.</p><h2>Curating the End-to-end Experience: Example 2</h2><p>In another example, as one of my first projects ever I was asked to evaluate and give recommendations to improve the usability of one of our commercial (SMB) products. Initially, executives suggested we needed just a configuration interface. However, after a set of comparative usability studies, we found serious bottlenecks. Competitive products took only 35 minutes for a novice to deploy. Contrast that with our product: 0% of novices could successfully deploy the device, and only 50% of experts could configure our products in four hours. Users encountered challenges at every touch point, including identifying the appropriate cables and connectors, connecting them to the right ports, and then configuring the device. The accessory kit included 300 pages of reference documentation that none of our users found useful. In the end, we did design an application UI, but we also simplified the total experience at every other touch point as well. We defined standards for hardware, including industrial design, color-coded cabling, accessory kit contents, as well as documentation that have lasted nearly 20 years.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Configuration Wizard (Windows 95)\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a08256af-b281-462e-a053-83c5b01ef9fd\" src=\"/images/FastStep-Wizard.png\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: Configuration Wizard (Windows 95)</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p>After implementing our recommendations, it took a novice less than 20 minutes from opening the box to surfing the Web. The SVP of the business unit said “Jim, I can’t say that our success was entirely due to your team. But, without the work you did, we never would have been as successful as fast.” In the end, entering this market when they did earned the company more than $2 Billion per year and provided a competitive advantage for four years. In this case, the experience itself differentiated even a highly technology-driven company.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Open Me First Bag with Color Coded Cables\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"8d02eeac-abaa-4d8c-ab3d-61416b59e972\" src=\"/images/Accessory-Kit.jpg\" /><figcaption>Figure 3: Open Me First Bag, Color-coded Cables, and Quick Start Guide</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>What is the role of a User Experience team when product teams are unwilling to revisit challenges customers have with their product? This was the challenge I faced when I arrived at Yahoo! and took over the UX team for Advertising. Specifically, Yahoo Search Marketing was very difficult to use. Members of the product team had been hearing from the UX team for a year before I arrived that the product had challenges, and they didn’t want to hear it any more. No matter how valid and reliable the data, the team found ways to ignore insights.</p><p>I suggested to the SVP of the organization that we were at a crisis that was going to impact us all, and recommended we bring the cross-functional team together to identify how we could increase profitable revenue. Specifically, I recommended facilitating a Rapid Design Lab. He agreed.</p><p>What is a rapid design lab? Rapid design labs are multi-day collaborative workshops where teams work together to solve major business problems. Teams review challenges, leverage intensive brainstorming and structured ideation exercises, engage in exercises to converge and validate ideas, and align around these ideas. In design labs, designers, engineers, product managers, and often users engage in brainstorming, convergence, collaborative design rapid prototyping, and user testing.</p><p><img alt=\"Team Ideating in Rapid Design Lab\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b0303d4d-674a-4ed1-9c04-4c3ac36ff78d\" src=\"/images/RapidDesignLabs.jpg\" /></p><p></p><p>Because the existing product had so many challenges and the team would not prioritize changes, we found an alternate path to success: We defined a new product. Product Management agreed that we could create a much more focused, simpler desktop-based product to meet a use case that would help us monetize at a much higher rate. This ideation and definition process represented the first two days of the workshop.</p><p>Over the next two days, we sketched the new product, identified the core and differentiating capabilities, and then tested paper prototypes with users. On the last day of this five-day rapid design lab, each stakeholder agreed to a set of tasks that their organization would complete to drive the product forward.</p><p>It is important to note that leading up to this design lab, stakeholders from different groups seldom collaborated, and competed in unhealthy ways. During the rapid design lab, they came together and solved a big problem to produce a series of successes they had previously not experienced. Not only did each person in the design lab have emotional attachment to the new idea, but the design lab increased trust, candor, and collaboration among stakeholders. In the end, each individual took action to convince his or her executive staff. Each organization felt that the new idea arose organically from within their team, and thus they felt motivated to ensure its success. When we work together to solve real problems, organizations not only support the new concepts, but defend them on an emotional level.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Team Ideating in Rapid Design Lab\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b0303d4d-674a-4ed1-9c04-4c3ac36ff78d\" src=\"/images/Sketches-combined.jpg\" /><figcaption>Sketches of the new desktop tool during the rapid design lab</figcaption></figure></p><p>In the end, after deciding to build this product, we formed a very small team of approximately eight core members that worked in an Agile model and produced the new desktop search marketing product six months later. Note that as a comparison, the main product took over a hundred engineers three years to build. The result was that 95% of users—even novices—could successfully create a new search marketing campaign on the first attempt. From a revenue standpoint, we saw a 16% uplift in the first month this product was available.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Graph showing how experience-led companies outperform their competition by over 200%\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"4e8e78bd-17a9-4f45-9600-f4080da93044\" src=\"/images/YSMD_ALL.jpg\" /><figcaption>Sketches of the new desktop tool during the rapid design lab</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><h2>Rapid Design Labs – Accelerating Convergence</h2><p>I have been conducting Rapid Design Labs to rapidly define transformative new product ideas and align cross-functional teams around these ideas for 15 years. Today, virtually every design agency offers its own unique flavor of innovation workshop. Such workshops are based on the concept of design-thinking, which is essentially a user-centered design process.</p><p>Rapid Design Labs enable teams to accomplish innovation and alignment that would typically take six months or more to achieve. At the end, they have a buildable product that customers will buy and users love.</p><p>In the end, Rapid Design Labs provide four basic value points. They enable:</p><ul><li>Rapid Innovation. Design labs are often also called Innovation Workshops.</li><li>Cross-functional synthesis. Design labs solve pressing problems in a matter of days that can take many months—or even years—to solve otherwise. These workshops apply integrative thinking at the organizational level. In essence, experts in different disciplines (engineering, product management, and user experience) all perceive the world differently, including opportunities and constraints. Moreover, corporate culture rewards each discipline trying to push their opinion as the right one. Without all key stakeholders though, one cannot build products that differentiate, are marketable, and technically feasible. We need to leverage the best possible insights from each field. Design labs help synthesize different insights across disciplines.</li><li>Deep accelerated dialogue. A big obstacle to innovation is the surface-level dialogue in most organizations, fragmented across meetings, email, and PowerPoint presentations. Design labs enable deeper dialogue. They bring teams together to solve problems in a shared space, which when facilitated properly by an experienced leader builds trust. Common goals ensure the teams must show productive output when they emerge from their multi-day event.</li><li>Pivoting through lean design. In The Lean Startup, Eric Ries argues that the runway for any new product or company is defined by how many times it can successfully pivot itself—change direction—to deliver real customer value. Design labs are the perfect tool for lean design: They permit fast, cheap, objective pivots.</li></ul><p></p><p>The job of a UX leader is to accelerate the dialog and convergence around experiences that both delight users and generate more profitable revenue. Rapid Design Labs are one of the tools that can help.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Great design leaders recognize that they need user researchers who can draw on the framework of Lean and rapid contextual research to engage in Lean Ethnography. They rapidly identify unmet user needs, and emotional connectors to a product or service. They ensure the product is intuitive, satisfying, and delightful. I call this model my Logical-Emotional Experience Paradigm, a term similar to what Tim Parsey, former VP of UX at Yahoo articulated back in 2011. More recently Kelly Goto, a tremendously gifted researcher and leader of an agency that cares deeply about developing products that users love, codified this model even more clearly. Following this model, researchers and designers create experiences that create a positive engagement for their users. At the same time, they support users in completing real objectives efficiently.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Jim's Logical Emotional Design Paradigm\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"683f1b16-051a-4d68-8700-cb7196592597\" src=\"/images/Log-Emot-Experience.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Jim's Logical Emotional Design Paradigm</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p> </p><h2> </h2><h2>Lean Ethnography- What Is It?</h2><p>Recently when talking with a User Research leader who I respect deeply, I said tongue-in-cheek that I will probably never hire another <span class=\"s1\"><i>traditional</i></span> user researcher. To my surprise, she agreed! Don’t get me wrong. UX teams need to understand user needs, and ultimately to find the key emotional connectors to your product. The reality though is that we can draw on the framework of lean processes and rapid contextual research to engage in Lean Ethnography.  </p><p>The reality is that having the right features that are usable is just foundational. We also need to understand the factors that drive a positive or negative emotional connection to our products.</p><h2>Finding Logical, Emotional Drivers</h2><p>User research has to identify the logical and the emotional drivers of users’ connections to a product and brand. People cannot often express why they are emotionally connected to something. They just love it or they hate it. If we can meet users’ deeper emotional needs, they will defend our products beyond logic. You may be familiar with the phrase (attributed widely to Mark Twain) “You cannot displace, through logical argumentation, a position that was arrived at emotionally.” We want people to defend us emotionally, and logically. What one company can you think of that customers support beyond any rational position? That is a company whose profits will continue to soar.</p><p>The question then is whether we can create products that are easy to use, but also beautiful, that feel fantastic to touch and use. Can we have products that are intuitive, satisfying, and delightful? We can, and it doesn’t need to take months.</p><p>I love the way Samsung conducted research into how they could connect on a deeper emotional level to their users, so they would love the new Samsung Galaxy III and later phones. In the end, the Galaxy rivals the iPhone for market share, so the research paid off.</p><h2>Lean Ethnography- A Case Study</h2><p>The issue here is that Lean for design and engineering needs to mean lean for UX Research as well. UX Researchers need to find new ways to gather the right data fast. Saying “sorry, we can’t respond with data in the next two weeks 10 days, because the research will take 3 months minimum” is seldom the right answer.There are cases when it should take this long, but they are increasingly rare. Some researchers will say “Jim, you don’t get it,” and I’m completely OK with that. We won’t work together. Let me share an example.</p><p>Last year, this very issue arose: I prompted my team to think up the next generation device user experience for their delivery service drivers in seven days. Now, the researchers on the project told me it would take at least a month to conduct the user research to provide data to inform a high-quality vignette. We just didn’t have a month. We had a couple days to gather research and five work days to prepare our solution. Rather than walk away, we did some guerilla research: We ordered several pick-ups and deliveries from a delivery service in a two-day period. We observed the drivers, and asked numerous questions, so we could very rapidly understand their context of use, their current challenges, their goals, both explicit and implicit, and what connects them emotionally to their current process, good and bad. In doing so, we were able to create the vignette, or visual story, highlighting a new mobile solution in five days. As part of our research, we learned about the drivers’ conscious goals, and their unconscious goals, their obvious challenges, and their unstated challenges. </p><p>In the following vignettes, we highlight the recommended solution, as well as some of the key emotional motivators for these delivery drivers. After creating this visualization, we then work with the engineering team to define what is technically feasible. So, rather than the technology being defined first, we envision the solution first, then define how we can achieve this vision. Of course, there are tradeoffs, but in the end, these vignettes highlight the desired experience, which can help guide the product development team.</p><p><img alt=\"Lean Ethnography- Case Study\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"886f3e39-4480-46a4-8a32-502732686ff6\" src=\"/images/Lean-Ethno-2.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p> </p><p><img alt=\"Douglas- Package Delivery Driver Stacks Higher and Faster\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"be586bfb-bced-496f-8100-b40f9e773222\" src=\"/images/Lean-Ethno-3.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p><img alt=\"Douglas learns what he can to improve customer service\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"65f10226-a3c4-4dc9-8d04-4ed37647e4ec\" src=\"/images/Lean-Ethno-4.png\" class=\"align-right\" /></p><p> </p><h2>Now, what if we could capture all of Douglas' tacit knowledge...</h2><h2>then add technology to it?</h2><p> </p><h2>Framework</h2><p>Our two key design drivers: Contextual knowledge and efficiency.</p><ul><li>The less the driver has to look at the device, the better.</li><li>Time used in navigating and interacting with the device is inefficient time.</li><li>The driver needs to focus on  the road, on the customer and on looking and understanding his whereabouts.</li></ul><h3>Contextual Knowledge</h3><p>The interface automatically adjusts to show what is relevant to Douglas in each step of delivery.

Designing for mobile first brought us a laser focus to simplify the experience, to reveal only the core functions that are relevant in specific contexts.</p><p></p>We looked at some key examples. Take email for instance (a dying modality?). In a mobile context, we mostly read and send terse messages- we have very targeted interactions. Contrast that with the desktop, where we have access to more, including filters, calendar, notes and so on. In mobile, each function is a separate app: Email, Calendar and Notes.

However, going from desktop to mobile in most cases requires completely rethinking the purpose of the mobile app. It truly is easier to do the hard work of starting with mobile and taking our insights to inform the desktop design.</p><p>As the leader of the UX Design Studio, I functioned as Creative Director for the teams designing and prototyping these applications.</p><h2>Check-In Application</h2><p>The Check-In application turns an airline agent standing behind a desk into mobile concierge, who provides a high-touch experience. Airlines had a hard time expanding and contracting from peak to low season and back, and paid a significant amount for extra desk space in the airport. At the same time, these airlines had plenty of agents at the airport. Their challenge with checking in passengers faster was desk space. The mobile concierge concept had the potential to improve the travel experience by decreasing time to check in and increasing human contact for those who wanted it.</p><p>To be effective though, a mobile concierge must be able to do several things quickly, while talking with a passenger: Find flights and look up customers, indicate the number of passengers traveling together, tag luggage, sell amenities, change seats, accept multiple forms of payment, and to print tickets and receipts.</p><p>In the end, we simplified and optimized the experience so a mobile concierge could check passengers in faster than agents standing at a desk using their old systems.</p><p>We conducted research, designed the app, made it white-labelable by multiple airlines, and built a fully functional prototype working on mobile devices in six months. Our ability to move rapidly secured partnerships with a number of airlines, who partnered with us on this initiative and several innovation efforts going forward. It opened a $100 Million sales pipeline for the organization.</p><h2>In-flight Entertainment Application</h2><p>Airlines also needed to find a way to be able to evolve their in-flight entertainment offerings, including no longer installing expensive and heavy video equipment in each airplane. Rather, they wanted to offer an app that could run on a mobile device. First class passengers would be handed a tablet, while other passengers could run the app on their own device.</p><p>We adhered to the same principles as for the check-in app, and also agreed that we needed this app to have a high contrast ratio, so entertainment could be seen in either dark or bright ambient light.</p><p><img alt=\"In-flight entertainment application\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"23a62c03-828e-4242-9d5a-903197131ff5\" src=\"/images/IFE-Composite.png\" /></p><p>The application needed to have several categories, in addition to just entertainment, including games, merchandising and publications for reading. Here is a subset of these screens:</p><p> </p><h2>Movies</h2><h2><img alt=\"In-flight entertainment app showing Movies section\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"500f5e2d-5db1-4fad-9800-a2084b40e04f\" src=\"/images/IFE-Movies.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Games</h2><h2><img alt=\"In-flight entertainment app showing Games section\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"965cbb10-fd85-43cc-9400-e55abbe36162\" src=\"/images/IFE-Games.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Merchandising</h2><h2><img alt=\"In-flight entertainment app showing Merchandising section\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"cec95678-0b0f-48bc-8a00-aca635da0d26\" src=\"/images/IFE-Merch.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></h2><p> </p><h2>Publications</h2><h2><img alt=\"In-flight entertainment app showing Movies section\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"19075e93-fab4-4dcf-9700-d178b05195b1\" src=\"/images/IFE-Publications.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></h2><p></p><h2>Making Each Application Brandable</h2><p>Finally, we also created a cabin-crew application that enabled flight attends to:</p><ul><li>recognize and reward loyal and high-value customers</li><li>sell merchandise with ease</li><li>access information about other crew members flying with them</li><li>view forms, manuals, and training materials</li></ul><p></p><p>We made these applications white-labelable (brandable), so any airline could brand the apps as their own.</p><p><img alt=\"Blue, Yellow, and Purple versions of In-flight Entertainment app\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"28114e16-0292-418f-963c-6047ebfa314a\" src=\"/images/Cabin-Crew-White-Label.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p>If you’d like, just ask, and I’ll show this application as well.</p><p> </p>",

        "body": "<p>To inspire and engage internal stakeholders, and align cross-functional teams around a common vision of our users, I innovated with our personas. In producing the definitive set of personas, though we created buzz and aligned cross-functional teams, using action figures stirred controversy in the UX field. I decided it was more important to establish a dialog about what innovation really is and think outside the typical box, rather than follow the traditional UX path.</p><p>My UX team had a deep understanding of both conscious and unconscious needs of our users, but also needed to make personas sticky (memorable) for product teams. Before our personas, different product teams used their own personas, which were not based on user research, because nobody had presented personas in a highly professional fashion up to that point. We also noticed that in this particular corporate culture, many engineers collected action figures, such as Captain America, and so on.</p><p>At the same time, working in a corporation takes an emotional toll on a team over time, and I wanted to reinvigorate energy and creativity among my UX team. Thus, I decided to use action figures to represent our personas. As I mentioned, doing so also stirred up controversy within the UX field, as purist researchers felt that personas <em>must</em> be represented by a human photo to create empathy. Interestingly, I found no research that proved we cannot empathize with a non-human character (action figure). In fact, I found research suggesting we may be able to empathize just as much. What's more, we found empathy with our non-human personas to be just as high, but <span class=\"s1\"><em>much</em></span> more importantly, we achieved our stated goal—that product teams <span class=\"s1\"><em>recollected</em></span> and <span class=\"s1\"><em>recognized</em></span> our personas and their characteristics much more than if they were not presented in unique and interesting ways. We got their attention, and they loved it!</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Eagle-Eye Ed Reseller Persona\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"d4b5998c-3a27-41f1-bb1a-26a0f3698f0e\" src=\"/images/EagleEyeEd.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Fig 1: Eagle-Eye Edward, a Reseller Persona</figcaption></p><p> </p><p>We even created pop-ups for each persona, and created a poster saying “Collect All Seven!” Shortly thereafter, we found engineers bartering for different pop-up action figures, and several had the whole set on their desks.</p><p>Moreover, the UX team won an award for innovation presented by vice presidents from across the company for having developed these personas. </p><p>The lesson in this effort is <span class=\"s1\"><i>not</i></span> that we should or should not use human personas or action figures. It is that when innovating, you have to step out of the box that says “this is the way everyone agrees it should be done (so don’t be different!).”</p><h2>How We Defined and Created These Personas</h2><p>To craft each persona we of course gathered significant research to understand user characteristics, business objectives, priorities, likes, dislikes, and insights or product considerations. We then defined example physical charactersistics of each persona, based on actual people in the roles that the persona represented. We also identified key accessories they carry with them. For exmple, we highlighted the types of clothes they might wear, the type of briefcase they might carry, the type of cup or mobile phone they might carry, and so on. We then had these personas built as action figures (yeah, dolls), along with these accessories, leveraging a company we worked with in China.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Example Accessories Used to Define a Persona\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"433bfe9b-ce14-4de9-9100-bc2323b837f8\" src=\"/images/Ed-Accessories.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Fig 2: Example Accessories Used to Define a Persona</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p>We then did photo shoots and Photo-shopped the action figures into typical scenarios, within environments where we might typically find them. </p><p><figure><img alt=\"Ed Presenting In A Sales Meeting\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"69a291a4-6248-4d3c-a922-347b3a10f715\" src=\"/images/Ed-Photo-Shoot-1.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Fig 3: Example Photo Shoot- Sales Meeting</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt=\"Photo Shoot- Working with Expert\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"34f06063-2019-4e17-9c00-bb30766d4fb0\" src=\"/images/Ed-Photo-Shoot-2.png\" class=\"align-center\" /><figcaption>Fig 4: Photo Shoot- Working with Expert</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt=\"Photo Shoot- Driving\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"d1086fe9-5c50-4a53-9405-5d19e5ff09b9\" src=\"/images/Ed-Driving.png\" class=\"align-right\" /><figcaption>Fig 5: Photo Shoot- Driving</figcaption></figure></p><p> </p><h2>Lessons</h2><p>When people say “you don’t understand; you can’t do it that way,” you need to consider valid concerns, but then find the best way to work around those concerns and drive hard to your larger goal. By nature, innovative ideas represent new ways of thinking, which means you need to drop old ways of thinking and operating. Several \"experts\" criticized our personas, saying that by showing our customers as dolls, we did not respect them. Quite the contrary: We polled numerous customers, and most of them saw the humor in representing users as action figures. Several even thought we should take it farther and represent them as <em>Action Heroes</em>, with capes and disguises! Rather, I found that in the UX industry, we have a large number of purists who articulate how things should be, and others line up behind them, fearful of trying anything new. In the end, should we use non-human characters to represent personas? Honestly, I am not attached to representing them in any way. The key here is that these personas representations engaged product teams in a dialog about users in a way human characters had not to that point. They created a stickiness, and ensured that product teams developed solutions based on having internalized the characteristics of these archetypical users.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Multitasking Millie- Popup Concept\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ce14e19c-8339-44da-800b-114c50e0e11c\" src=\"/images/Millie-Horiz-Popup.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 6: Concept Artwork for a Three-fold Popup, Using Multitasking Millie</figcaption></figure></p><p> </p><p>In the end, the benefits of this effort were manifold. First, Engineering embraced the concept and engaged with the personas, designing products around these users’ needs. But also, executives got excited about User Experience in ways they had never previously been. For example, as the company was establishing cross-company Councils to break down silos, executive sponsors invited me to work with them to understand their customers, and how to increase our traction with customers. This effort in fact led to two specific initiatives, where the UX group was able to redesign experiences that led to more than $100 Million in revenue above goal. It also led to the Chief Marketing Officer working with me and my team, and to updating the corporate tagline from a technology tagline, to a tagline that put humans at the center of the technology equation. Here are examples of a couple additional marketing artifacts we used to build excitement for these personas.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Persona Pop-up, Front and Back\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"0b5f2779-366f-45fa-af2b-43c59863b1d2\" src=\"/images/Millie-Front-n-Back.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 7: Persona Pop-up, Front and Back</figcaption></figure></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><figure><img alt=\"Persona Marketing Persona\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"78e79bd9-819f-4112-a700-b0f9e7c6808d\" src=\"/images/Personas-Sumry-Postr.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 8: Internal Persona Marketing Poster- Choose The Right Persona!</figcaption></figure></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><figure><img alt=\"Internal Persona Marketing Poster- Collect All 7!\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"d32c0ddd-6ea2-402b-aa00-fbcf5feb8739\" src=\"/images/Collect-all-7_0.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 9: Internal Persona Marketing Tool: Collect All 7!</figcaption></figure></p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><h2>The Value of Persona-based Design</h2><p>This would not be a complete discussion of personas without highlighting the value of persona-based design. Since Cooper wrote the book <span class=\"s1\"><i>The Inmates Are Running the Asylum</i></span> back in the early 1990’s, different organizations have begun leveraging personas in different ways, for different purposes. Having said this, a Marketing persona is different from a persona used for design and development. A dev-based persona is an archetypical representation of up to three of the target users for your product. You include key attributes and attitudes, both conscious and unconscious, but only as they relate to the use of your product, site, or the products sold on your site. The persona details have to highlight possible attractors and challenges. What are the persona’s likes, loves, dislikes, challenges, and hates. In my Logical-Emotional design model, we need to design to support user tasks, but also understand how to connect with the user emotionally. For example, what makes them feel cool, or what gives them a deeper sense of meaning? For example, what can you do to make your users the center of attention socially? What can you do to empower your users, to make them appear to be the most intelligent users of products like yours in you domain? So, go document via personas both these process-centered design parameters (how to optimize for user success), as well as emotional connectors. If you do, you will have captured both the logical and the emotional drivers for your product, and your users will defend your solution to the death!</p><p>Several books have also emerged that highlight the negative aspects of persona-based design when leveraged improperly. For example, Phil Terry in his book <em>Customers Included</em> suggests that personas are not useful for design. I agree with his larger point, that his Listening Labs are also valuable, because they provide insights into real user needs. However, when scaling across multiple developers, teams, and projects, persona-based design can be extremely valuable. Yes, teams need to include only useful information in persona definitions. For example, I've seen personas for digital designs that include the persona's height. Useful? Not a chance, unless you're designing something physical, like a pair of pants or a cockpit for a car or airplane. But, if you have the right UX leader driving your team, they can make sure you have the right persona attributes, and that the designs differentiate! </p>",

        "body": "<p>UX teams can do more than produce tactical wireframes. We can also help envision an end-to-end experience for our users. As Marty Cagan says in his book INSPIRED: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love, teams have an opportunity to create requirements documents and designs together, and validate real concepts in the market before committing to build the product or service.</p><p>That’s what we did in this example— PM defined the opportunity in the marketplace and wrote stories outlining the important new capabilities that benefit customers. UX refined this storyline and crafted vignettes or visual stories that demonstrate a streamlined experience using these wireframes. We presented these designs together with stories from the PM as a cohesive requirements definition.</p ><p> As a general practice, UX needs to prototype our concepts, preferably very early in the cycle. When we can do this in the form of wireframes, we can get feedback rapidly. I like to conduct performance-based studies with users, and to engage in internal design reviews where we walk through scenarios with executives and product team members.</p><p>In this example, the vignettes helped me enroll executives and customers. I generally like to hold regular design reviews with executives and product team members. In this example, we did both, and we added one step: We showed wireframes to customers during user-group meetings to highlight the final simplified experience. Until this time, product teams had only shown Powerpoint presentations that highighted theoretical functionality. Presenting our validated vignettes built credibility, because the scenario-based wireframes brought concepts to life. This example shows only the rough wireframes. We also showed one visually high-fidelity story. If you’d like to see those, let me know.</p><p></p><h2>Challenge</h2><p>We were defining this set of apps for airlines. While airline systems today can identify premium customers, there is very limited functionality to treat these customers differently based on their individual value. Personalization of services and amenities cannot be individualized for a single customer in real time. Our system uses customer profile and valuation to provide personalized service that improves the customer experience.</p><h2>Personas</h2><p>Note that our team defined personas in great detail for each of the following roles. For more information about what attributes to include when defining personas, refer to my article “Innovation Requires Thinking Differently.” This section does not include details on the personas for brevity.</p><h3>Consumer Personas</h3>The Brown Family is an average family with three school-aged kids:<ul><li>The father, John Brown, is a top level tier member with FlyAway Airlines</li><li>The mother, Lisa, is a home-maker with a part time job</li><li>Anne, who is a 13-year-old daughter</li><li>Steven, who is a 10-year-old son</li><li>Jeffrey, who is an 8-year-old son.</li></ul><p></p><p>The Brown family lives 40 miles west of Atlanta, Georgia.</p><h3>Airline Agent Personas</h3>This part of the overall solution has three personas: Call-center agents, check-in agents, and gate agents:<ul><li>Karen Nichols and Lynette Rogers –Airline call-center agents, who use the system to create bookings.</li><li>Jack Nelson – Airline Check-In Agent</li><li>Sue Smith – Airline Gate Agent</li></ul><p></p><h2>Scenario</h2><p>John and Lisa decide to take a family vacation. They have a budget of $2,200 for the flights. They know they wanted a warm destination, and they preferred a flight of no longer than six hours, with no changing planes (which presents a hassle with three kids). They can spend all of the spring school vacation period, but tend to make it between eight and 10 days. The travel dates are flexible within the two-week period. Both John and Lisa find it a hassle to book the whole vacation on the Internet, and they both like personalized service when they can get it. They therefore decide to call the airline directly. By initially searching flights on the Internet, FlyAway Airlines appeared to have the largest number of offers from Atlanta (the closest city to where they live). They have six suitcases, a golf bag and are worried about keeping the kids busy on the plane.</p><h3>The Reservations Application</h3><p>Although this article shows a set of screens, we actually worked hard to define the UX architecture, or Interaction Design (IxD) Model first, to ensure the application held together for all its different users. For more information about defining IxD models, refer to the article “First, Define the UX Architecture—the Interaction Model—for your Apps.” The following wireframes worked to prove out the IxD Model for these applications, and drove refinements. Any IxD Model needs to work in the crucible of the real world.</p><h3>Context: Using Illustrator and Artboards to Create Wireframes</h3><p>After joining this organization, I was the sole designer on this project for three months, while I hired a new team. I used Adobe Illustrator for wireframing and Photoshop for high-fidelity mockups, because they afforded me power and flexibility. To create the feel that the user was moving from one real screen to another, I used symbol files for common elements, and established a template for my artboards.</p><p>Today, I tend to use Sketch and InVision for prototypes, or go straight to HTML and Javascript. However, in 2012, Sketch and InVision did not exist.</p><p>Here's an example of aset of artboards that I used to include all screens for one complete user flow.</p><p><img alt=\"Adobe Illustrator Artboards for All Screens Comprising a Complete User Flow\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"f334603c-cd1b-4627-a64b-75030acf224e\" src=\"/images/Artboard.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p> </p><p>In the end, I created more than <em>250 screens</em> across seven primary scenarios. I show only one scenario in this example, because even just this scenario includes almost 60 screens.</p><h2>Vignettes of a new travel booking experience</h2><p>The following scenario and vignettes show how we would support a complex user goal in as simple a manner as possible.</p><h3>Lisa Calls the FlyAway Airlines Call Center</h3><p>In the first part of the scenario, Lisa calls the FlyAway Airlines Call Center and is connected to Karen, an airline call center representative. The caller ID system provides the phone number the call is coming from, which enables the system to pull up the customer profile linked to the phone number (linked to John). With Mr. Brown’s profile in front of Karen, she quickly reviews it. However, she hears a woman’s voice, not a man’s. She therefore asks whom she is speaking with, and learns she is speaking with Mrs. Brown (Lisa). Therefore, Karen clicks John Brown’s name, and gets a dropdown, with all of the family members who are associated with Mr. Brown.</p><p><img alt=\"Wireframing- Lisa Brown Calls the Reservation Center\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"be6dec2a-0e57-491f-a212-182027645c14\" src=\"/images/WF-1_3.jpg\" /></p><p>Karen selects Lisa Brown.</p><p><img alt=\"Wireframing- Karen selecting Lisa Brown\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"20aab23a-3fa5-46b6-980d-13bebb6adb71\" src=\"/images/WF-2-alt_4.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p> </p><p>Note that in the Left of the screen, in the area we called the Finding, the system shows the customer, who is of course Lisa.</p><p>Lisa explains the family’s plans. Because Lisa’s trip is based less on destination, and more on objectives, Karen has to select Advanced Options.

        "summary": "When designing complex interactions, UX leaders often need to push for a cohesive interaction model- a design model that binds an app together so it supports the conceptual models of its target users.",
        "body": "<p>When I joined HP to lead the UX Studios for Consumer Travel, my goal was to design products that transform the future of travel. Unfortunately, I had to throw existing designs away and start from scratch. Why? Existing designs did not follow a cohesive interaction model- a design model that binds an app together so it supports the conceptual models of its target users. It ensures users are always oriented and that they can predict how to take actions to achieve their goals.</p><p>Initially, the application screens were all based on a single master page template, which meant that every design had to fit within a specific structure, regardless of task. Moreover, the application was broken into tabs, such that any given role had to select a tab to have access to their tasks. Unfortunately, tabs did not offer a logical or parallel structure. Such a navigational model could work fine for an informational site, but not for an application that needs to make airline agents efficient. Finally, to adhere to the master templates, designers had to nest key functionality two layers deep, which in most cases made no sense. The fact is that different users had a very different conceptual model of the tasks they needed to perform.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Initial Master Page Template (An Example of Poor Design)\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"3ce46978-8c7e-4425-a751-81708c96774f\" src=\"/images/Initial-Jetstream-Master-Pages.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Master Page Template- An Example of Poor Design</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p>However, we needed to identify the conceptual model for each user, and craft an interaction model for the app that supported these conceptual models. Let’s step back and address some key questions:</p><ul><li>Why can’t a team just use a master page template for their designs?</li><li>What is a conceptual model and an interaction model?</li><li>What did our interaction model look like?</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Not Use Master Page Templates?</h2><p>I often hear people—even experienced designers—suggest that they can quickly create a global template or an information architecture, and then begin designing. Now, if they’re designing the simplest of Web portals, they may be right. Global templates are akin to style guides that strictly enforce exactly where every element goes—not just on one page or screen, but across many of them. Style guides and UI standards and style guides can actually reduce the likelihood of producing great design. As Jared Spool highlighted at SXSW 2011 in his presentation “Rule-based Decisions versus Informed Decisions,” UI standards and guidelines are essentially rules that teams must follow regardless.</p><p>The challenge with rule-based design is that it fails on any exception cases. Of course, design is all about solving real problems (where exceptions are the rule!). Style guides do not work to promote great design, because every design is by definition different. Every design solves a different problem, and therefore should have a different solution. Unfortunately, business leaders often ask me to create style guides, and we have known way too many designers who still believe that producing and following style guides can deliver great design. Here is another example of where we differ as an industry, and need to start coming together with a single answer. It’s a black-and-white case: Style guides are bad. Pattern libraries, when implemented correctly though, can enhance the quality of design. An interaction model, on the other hand, is more like a design pattern and design principles that describe the ways in which objects relate, with many sub-patterns that together describe the model. The difference is that interaction models leave room for designers to solve users’ real problems, which is in fact the very purpose of Interaction Design.</p><h2>What is a Conceptual Model and an Interaction Model?</h2><p> </p><p>A conceptual model represents the mental framework from which a user approaches a task or goal. We can see conceptual models in action when we consider a few Microsoft Office products:</p><ul><li>Microsoft Word reflects and supports the conceptual model of a person who inserted a piece of paper into a typewriter in portrait mode. The user can simply type and produce an artifact, such as a letter. Of course, they have a significant amount of value-added features.</li><li>Microsoft PowerPoint on the other hand, supports the conceptual model of a person who wrote on a clear plastic sheet—typically in landscape mode—and set it on top of an overhead projector. Of course, PowerPoint also has additional value-added features.</li><li>Microsoft Excel supports the conceptual model of an accountant working with rows of entries and columns of numbers. Again, Excel also has additional value-added features.</li></ul><p><figure><img alt=\"Example Conceptual Model for Airline Agents\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"3de5ef43-20ad-499f-a140-641842fed155\" src=\"/images/IxD-Model-3.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: Example Conceptual Models for Different Airline Agents</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p>The interaction model (IxD Model) for each of these applications differs in the right way—to support the conceptual model of users performing different tasks. </p><p>Thus, these concepts are highly practical, though they might at first seem unnecessarily cerebral. If you don’t understand a user’s conceptual model, you can’t define an IxD model that supports and enhances their experience. At times, we invent new ways of interacting, but more commonly, new interactions reflect real-world interactions. Even the swipe to unlock model follows a natural affordance.</p><h2 >What Did Our IxD Model and IxD Guide Look Like?</h2><p >Note that we created an 11” x 17” booklet that we could hand to customers, developers, product managers, and anyone else who needed to understand our customers’ mental framework for approaching their tasks, and the UX architecture we would follow to support their tasks in the most natural way. Here’s one page from our 110-page IxD Guide, highlighting the basic Interaction Model for this family of products:</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Basic Interaction Model for a Family of Travel Products\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"996bf07c-503d-42a9-bf00-cc691e9726a8\" src=\"/images/IxD-Model-1.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 3: Basic Interaction Model for a Family of Products</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p >An interaction model then defines how all of the objects and actions that are part of an application interrelate in ways that mirror and support real-life user interactions. It ensures that users always stay oriented and understand how to move from place to place to find information or perform tasks. It provides a common vision for a portal or an application (desktop or mobile), including the types of attributes that are appropriate for each.</p><p>It enables designers, developers, and stakeholders to understand and explain how users move from objects to actions within a system. Defining the right interaction model is a foundational requirement for any digital system and contributes to a cohesive, overall UX architecture. </p><p>The interaction model is something that users internalize, but probably could not articulate—and wouldn’t care whether they could. Users internalize well-constructed interaction models, which make most actions within a system more predictable. Just as the book <em>The Invisible Computer</em> suggests, we often don’t notice a product or application when it works well. Clearly, then, there is no one-size-fits-all interaction model. Every product solves a different set of problems for different users, and therefore, requires a model that, as much as possible, reflects and supports their real-world interactions. Therefore, just as we defined the users' conceptual models, we also identified the top goals for the interaction design.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Interaction Design Goals\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a691d385-f3ed-4bfa-8000-d94b617cd86c\" src=\"/images/IxD-Model-2.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 4: Example Interaction Design Goals</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p> </p><p>An interaction model also describes the types of affordances to present in the application. For example, should a PC-based (non-mobile) application use more Web-portal affordances or desktop-application affordances? In our case, we decided to start with mobile first, to help bring focus and prioritize capabilities. But, even when moving from mobile to desktop, we don’t leverage the design exactly as presented on the mobile. On a mobile device, we have what we call guided mode, which includes only the key capabilities required to support a focused mobile experience. In Desktop applications, we leverage the entire desktop in more of a palette mode. </p><p><figure><img alt=\"Types of Interactions Define Affordance Types\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"cc2adb85-4906-496d-8900-c4ad1fe69f2b\" src=\"/images/IxD-Model-7.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 5: Types of Interactions Define the Types of Affordances</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Take email for example. On the desktop, in addition to reading messages, you can set rules, view calendars, notes, contacts, and tasks. On a mobile device (particularly a phone, which is the predominant mobile device used) we typically read and respond to email, but do less setting up of rules, organizing mailboxes, and so on. Therefore, the mobile email client can (and should) be more focused. However, they can follow the same basic interaction model, and should, to ensure the applications are predictable (not consistent, but predictable) across devices.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Device Characteristics\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b6eca7b8-b447-47dd-ab00-0bf24695245b\" src=\"/images/IxD-Model-8.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 6: Device Characteristics</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p>Thus, for our travel applications, we decided that even our Web applications would use only application affordances. At the simplest level, it would minimize use of underlined links and use more buttons. It would have a Maximize/Restore button that eliminates or restores the browser chrome, enabling the application to take up 100% of the usable space on the screen, similar to that on Cooliris, for example.</p><p>I have seen many UX teams with significant design skill craft applications that were not consistent in their affordances. Should they leverage web portal affordances? Web app affordances? Desktop affordances? Mobile affordances? The upshot for us was that, though we were designing the technology to be highly performant, for our web-app version of the product, we chose a desktop application metaphor. At times, it doesn’t matter what model you choose so much as just choosing a model and sticking with it.</p><p>How, then, do you define an application’s interaction model? It can take months, but in the end, when stakeholders look at the model, they typically say, “Of course! I get it! It’s simple!” In this way, defining an interaction model is not unlike complex mathematics. You expend effort to figure it out, but once you understand the model, it seems so simple, and you wonder why it took so long to understand it in the first place.</p><p>Defining our interaction model for consumer travel products took me a few months of user observations to understand how users conceptualized their goals. I also internalized how they thought about objects supporting those goals, and the actions they performed using those objects to achieve their goals. On this particular project, we’re designing consumer user interfaces for mobile, tablet, and the Web, as well airline agent user interfaces for the Web and tablet.</p><p>When focusing on agent interactions, we recognized that each type of agent had a different primary object for which they needed to solve problems. As we saw in the first image of the conceptual model, reservation agents taking calls to book a new flight or change an existing flight are focused on a customer who is on the phone. They need to solve problems for customers, such as booking a flight or changing a profile.</p><p>On the other hand, gate agents at an airport have a different goal, which they call closing a flight, and, thus, a different primary object on which they focus. Their supervisors measure their performance based on their ability to close flights, or get their flights away from the gate on time. Gate agents have several activities going on at the same time—all with a focus on getting a flight away from the gate on time. They need to make sure the passengers all have seats, award some upgrades, accommodate those on a waiting list either on the current or a later flight, and so on, but all of these activities are in service of closing a flight. Most of the gate agents I have observed care deeply about serving their customers—even if we don’t recognize it— but their continued employment depends on their getting flights away from the gate on time.</p><p>Here is how we translated the conceptual model into an IxD Model:</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Foundation of Our Interaction Model\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"583a07bc-5c56-440a-af48-72853ba0ecac\" src=\"/images/IxD-Model-5.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 7: Basic Foundation of Our Interaction Model</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Here is an example of how the interaction model applies to a Reservations Agent.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Example of an Interaction Model for a Reservations Agent\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7fbd30f9-720a-492d-ac14-202baaf7d7bf\" src=\"/images/IxD-Model-6.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 8: Example of an Interaction Model for a Reservations Agent</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p> </p><p>In the end, designers were able to easily internalize the design patterns required to design a highly usable, useful, and delightful application for each user. In addition, the IxD Guide helped engineers and product managers also internalize and articulate how the application worked or needed to be assembled to support different users’ goals. In other articles, I highlight specific screens in greater detail, including the workflow for different user roles, as well as branding for different airlines and third-party travel companies.

        "body": "<p>When I arrived to lead an Advertising Products UX team, my predecessors had build a new ad publishing tool. Unfortunately, Sales people in our own organization refused to use the product. The Senior VP of the Product organization and the Senior VP of the Sales organization jointly attended a meeting with the CEO to discuss the Sales team adopting it. The Senior VP of Sales argued that nobody asked them what they needed. The Senior VP of Product argued that Sales did not want to provide input, and just complained. In the end, the CEO told these two S-VPs that they had one year to get the Sales team using the new platform, or they would both be fired! That included getting feedback from sales, redefining the product roadmap, designing, building and releasing a new product.</p><p>Honestly, nobody else seemed eager to get in the middle of this emotional issue, because people’s careers were on the line. However, I tend to run toward the fire with a plan to resolve it, rather than away from it. As such, I approached the Senior Vice President of the Product organization (my S-VP) and asked him to let me lead a Rapid Design Lab to bring the teams together around a common vision. He agreed. It is true that such high stakes present risk, but in that risk arises opportunity to rise the tide for all organizations as well. In this case, I recognized the value of Rapid Design Labs, and had successfully brought teams together before using this method.</p><p>As part of the process, I formed an executive steering committee to which I could report on progress daily, to ensure complete and constructive participation. In this case though, the high stakes also promoted strong opinions and emotions.</p><p>In the end, in this Rapid Design Lab, we decided on a new design that reduced the number of pages with which users needed to interact. They were originally forced through a sequence of screens where they performed a single task on each screen. The problem was twofold: First, they had no context from screen to screen, so often had to go back to see what they had entered previously, and then return to a subsequent screen. Second, this forced process did not let them experiment, which they needed to be able to do several times before completing their workflow. </p><p>During the design lab, we took the original sequence of 15 screens down to a single workspace, where users could modify all of the different values, and see the results in real-time in one location. It sped the process and provided much-needed flexibility.</p><p> </p><p><img alt=\"More than 15 Screens\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"fe1ca1c1-3d48-45f0-a40c-1270b6d49811\" src=\"/images/Artboard.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p> </p><p>We also identified how to ensure the product was highly performant and scalable with large data sets, which though not easy, was something we did. One week later, we had an interactive prototype based on our designs from the design lab. A week after this, a sales representative presented the interactive prototype to the Senior VP of Product and Sales and said “this is what we want.” Because Engineering participated, they agreed they could build it. And, the Product team agreed that the new version of the product would also sell much better externally.</p><p>More importantly, in the next year, the Sales organization had adopted the product, and we highlighted a win to the press. The Senior VP of Sales said “My team is thrilled with the relationship we’ve built with your organization. Coming together… in the design labs… made my Sales team feel heard and empowered for the first time. I’m giving you a thumbs-up on your plans. I like it that we can go back to the CEO with a positive story.”</p><p><img alt=\"Search Results Page for the NDC TripAway app\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b0cded43-f606-4d9d-9c08-8ce34e8aadc6\" src=\"/images/ResGUI-1.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p> </p><p>The idea of Rapid Design labs spread across Yahoo!, and other product teams requested we teach them how to facilitate such labs. I have also taught over 1,000 other people in day-long classes how to conduct successful design labs, and have received a 6.59 out of 7 scoring from attendees.</p><p> </p>",

For more insights about this process, refer to my article <span class=\"s1\"><i>User Research and Visualization in the Lean UX World</i></span>. As we gathered these insights about the user’s mental model, we were able to form the basis for an Interaction Model, which binds an app together so it supports the conceptual models of its target users. It ensures users are always oriented and that they can predict how to take actions to achieve their goals.

In some cases, as in this example, we simply look at inspirations that support our primary and secondary research. In other cases, we might explore different aspects of tone, identity, personality, and language. The team would create exploration statement, such as “What if Apple designed an enterprise application,” “What if Frank Gehry designed a business dashboard,” or “What if Porshe designed a reporting tool?” As we explore the identity, our mood boards might show mash ups based on these exploration statements.</p><p>For personality, the team might agree on a set of personality types (such as “The Innovator,” “The Architect,” or “Sports Car.” Designers would then ideate on traits of each of these personality types. For example, the innovator might have these traits: Inspirational, ambitious, simple, consistent, future thinking, flawless, clean. The sports car might have thest traits: Fast, contemporary, fun, sexy, proud, envious. </p><p>We then expore different abstractions from the mood boards, including shapes and colors, then review different iterations.

        "body": "<p>The Sales team in the Consumer Travel division contacted us and said they had a meeting with executives from two cruise lines in ten weeks, and they wanted to see what we could do for them in that time.</p><p>I assembled a highly skilled team comprising UX, Product Management Engineering and Sales to craft an app that could differentiate cruise lines. The UX team comprised researchers, interaction designers, visual designers, and front-end developers (prototypers).</p><p>With no time to actually take a cruise, we interviewed 12 people of different ages and demographics who had taken cruises, and conducted retrospective ethnographic interviews. Rather than asking what they wanted, we walked through their actual experiences preparing for, during and after the cruise. We also interviewed four former customer-facing employees from cruise lines to gather their insights.</p><p>As a result of this research, we created an app that could run on a tablet or a smartphone. The cruiseline could hand tablets to high-value customers, and allow all other customers download the app on their tablet or smartphone. All of the information for each customer (per state room) would appear in the app based on their login ID, instead of having to print paper brochures highlighting activities, merchandise, and tours. Activities could also be added to a shared calendar, so everyone in the family knew what was planned and when. By loading the cruise-line application on their own mobile device before the trip began, they could begin reserving activities and events even before the trip started, and even book hotels and other events before the cruise began.</p><h3>Visual Itineraries, Activity Booking</h3><p>They would see a visual representations of their itinerary, with links to either onboard activities, venues, meals and shows that they could book and attend, or port-of-call activities, tours and exciting events. For example, a family might want to take a tour in Cozumel. When the tour is scheduled through the app, the cruise line earns a larger commission. When they exit the ship in Cozumel, the app directs them to the location where they would meet their tour director.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Daily Itinerary Screen\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"f335084c-ef80-4574-a95a-90c88769ead9\" src=\"/images/Cruise-2.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Daily Itinerary Screen</figcaption></figure><p></p><h3>Photo and Video Scrapbook Curation</h3><p>As they progress and take pictures and videos, the app tags locations and categorizes the photos into albums for easier curation later (Google Photos API). The API also allows passengers to tag family members, which enables it to automatically label a photo &ldquo;Sammy having fun at the pool!&rdquo; or &ldquo;The family snorkeling at South Beach.&rdquo; While enjoying activities, the app might also recommend other highly relevant activities that day.</p><p>The app would also be tied to the family&rsquo;s onboard identifier card, which enabled staff to scan their phone or tablet to identify them for purchases.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Photo Album Category Screen\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"f335084c-ef80-4574-a95a-90c88769ead9\" src=\"/images/Cruise-3.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Photo Album Category Screen</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><h3>Entertainment- Movies and Games</h3><p>The app would also provide entertainment in the form of movies (with parental controls) and games, including multiplayer games for multiple people onboard the ship.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Entertainment -&gt; Films Screen\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"f335084c-ef80-4574-a95a-90c88769ead9\" src=\"/images/Cruise-4.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Entertainment -&gt; Films Screen</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><figure><img alt=\"Photo Album Category Screen\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"f335084c-ef80-4574-a95a-90c88769ead9\" src=\"/images/Cruise-5.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Entertainment -&gt; Games Screen</figcaption></figure><p></p><h3>Shopping</h3><p>Passengers can of course shop online at any store onboard the ship, and order room service using the app.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Main Shopping Screen\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"f335084c-ef80-4574-a95a-90c88769ead9\" src=\"/images/Cruise-6.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Main Shopping Screen</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><h3>Summary</h3><p>In the end, my Innovation lab created a complete functional prototype that ran on a tablet as though it was connected to a back-end database (it used dummy data via JSON for this demo). Cruiseline executives were deeply impressed that such a large company could move as fast as we did to craft such a highly functional, useful and delightul app that focused on consumer delight, decreased workload for cruiseline staff, and increased revenue. In the end, these cruiselines purchased our ideas and assets and built the apps internally. However, they also purchased our services to train their staff in our LEAN User-centered Design processes. I interviewed their team members, taught a number of courses and led workshops to help them internalize Design Thinking and collaborative methods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Working with Product Management and Engineering, my UX Innovation Studio helped visualize the total customer journey for a traveler making a trip, from the point when they book the flight, to the time they return home. The goal for this project was to identify current bottlenecks in the customer's experience and how we could remove these bottlenecks while increasing revenue for airlines and other travel companies.</p><p>In this example, we envisioned the set of products we called \"Vision 2020,\" which highlighted a set of products we would put in motion, and which would be fully in place in five years. This solution automates the travel booking and travel experience for a persona named Candice. It highlights the stress points, and how our new products solve these challenges. Here is the Journey Map that highlights challenges, product options, and opportunities. Such a Journey Map is typically printed on large-format paper, so teams can review the steps in a collaboration space. However, for this Digital venue, I have cut the single horizontal image into three separate images, for increased clarity in a small format. Don't worry about being able to read the text in the screens. I'll show you those individually later.</p><h2>Journey Map, 1 of 3<img alt=\"Journey Map for Travel Buddy, screens 1 - 4\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"c59c6fd1-8c0e-4043-b213-195ce0700cc8\" src=\"/images/Candice1-4.png\" />Journey Map 2 of 3</h2><p><img alt=\"Journey Map for Travel Buddy, screens 5 - 8\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ce9a2ac3-3c90-4436-9900-aa742b97fc26\" src=\"/images/Candice5-8.png\" /></p><h2>Journey Map 3 of 3</h2><p><img alt=\"Journey Map for Travel Buddy, screens 10 - 12\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"0a712b44-8ed0-4915-ad20-328003028c8b\" src=\"/images/Candice9-12.png\" /></p><h2>Storyboards</h2><p>Note that the cross-functional team comprising Product Management, the User Experience Studios, and Engineering defined each screen in detail, as a way of highlighting what was possible for the organization to build, and the User Experience Studio created the style and actual illustrations.</p><h2>Screen 1, Candice Needs to Travel to New York</h2><p><img alt=\"Candice needs to travel to New York\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"27d945af-5668-49a3-982c-44eed940e931\" src=\"/images/Candice-2.png\" /></p><h2>Screen 2, Candice Books a Multimodal Trip Using Natural Language Queries</h2><p>In this case, Candice calls up Travel Buddy. She uses natural language to request a travel booking. She just has to say she needs to travel to New York next week, and Travel Buddy knows she is traveling from LAX, that her preference is to rent a limo to the airport, the airline she likes to fly, that she likes a car rental in New York, and her choice of hotels while staying in Manhattan. Typically, travelers spend up to five hours across 16 different websites to book the optimal trip. In this case, Candice just speaks her request into the system. Travel Buddy books her travel, and presents options for her to consider. She chooses one, and within five minutes, receives an itinerary.</p><p><img alt=\"Candice requests an itinerary from Travel Buddy\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"0d74b872-3d63-4b1a-8300-bb87c7c2e8ec\" src=\"/images/Candice-3.png\" /></p><h2>Screen 3, Candice is Automatically Rebooked and Notified</h2><p>In this screen, we recognize that typically, a flight cancellation results in the user not knowing about the cancellation until after they arrive at the airport, at which point, they often work frantically on their phone and working with customer service agents to get rebooked. At that point, they must wait, often for many hours, for the new flight to be assigned. Travel Buddy eliminates all this hassle by automatically rebooking not just the flight, but the Limo as well. All Candice knows is that she doesn't have to leave for an additional two hours. \"Cool\" she thinks.</p><p> </p><p><img alt=\"Candice is Automatically Rebooked\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7293e242-1e4f-47e6-b100-e94e8ea66c8f\" src=\"/images/Candice-4.png\" /></p><h2>Screen 4, Card- and Cashless Transaction with Limo, and Travel Buddy Converts to Audio</h2><p>In this screen, we highlight two important capabilities. First, when Candice arrives at the airport in her limo, her payment is handled automatically, because her credit card is on file (we identified this before Uber and Lyft). Thus, she doesn't need to fumble around for cash or a credit card, wait for a receipt, and have to calculate a tip- it's handled automatically for her. Second, Travel Buddy converts to Audio mode, so it can give her directions through her Bluetooth headset to check in for her flight inside the airport. It also shows turn-by-turn directions on her Smart Watch.</p><p><img alt=\"Travel Buddy Converts to Audio Mode\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"286a251e-c920-46a0-8b00-d4c9a3a6aa17\" src=\"/images/Candice-5.png\" /></p><h2>Screen 5, Travel Buddy Gives Audio Directions Inside the Airport and on Smart Watch</h2><p>Candice easily finds her way to the Baggage counter because of the step-by-step directions. She arrives at the baggage counter, and instead of having to wait in line anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour, a Mobile Concierge greets Candice. She taps her Smart Watch to the Concierge's tablet, and her profile and itinerary come up automatically for the agent. He is able to offer her upgrades to Business (for a fee), or offer her other amenities. He then taps Candice's watch, and transfers both her bag tags and boarding pass to her electronically.</p><p><img alt=\"Candice being checked in by a mobile concierge\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b6799a67-97db-4bd3-8200-0d90a4069c9f\" src=\"/images/Candice-6.png\" /></p><h2>Screen 6, Candice is Guided to the Precheck Line and Speeds Through</h2><p>Because Travel Buddy knows Candice has Global Entry status, it guides her to the TSA Precheck line, where she speeds through. She just scans the boarding pass that automatically appears on her watch, and shows her ID.</p><p><img alt=\"Candice at the TSA Precheck Line, scanning the boarding pass on her smart watch\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a89ae1fd-b6b9-49a9-ac00-a402ee0beb30\" src=\"/images/Candice-7.png\" /></p><h2>Screen 7, Candice is Guided to Shopping, then to the Executive Lounge</h2><p>After Candice got through Security, Travel Buddy checked her preferences and noticed from previous behaviors and from her preferences that she likes to shop once she's through security. The location-based system notices where she is currently, and asks her if she would like to shop or go to the Executive Lounge. She selects Shopping, so Travel Buddy shows her stores nearby where she might like to shop. It can also include discounts and other offers that these stores would like to present to travelers.</p><p>Travel Buddy also has a link for \"Executive Lounge.\" After she's done shopping, she taps this link, and Travel Buddy guides her to the lounge. </p><h2><img alt=\"Candice, being directed to shopping, then to the exec lounge on her smart watch\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"17cb9944-ad41-49da-b500-e47e9a7f064c\" src=\"/images/Candice-8.png\" /></h2><h2>Screen 8, Candice Automatically Gets into the Executive Club, and Watches a Movie</h2><p><span >When Travel Buddy registers that Candice is within 20 feet, it changes automatically to show a QR Code, which she scans at the Executive Lounge to confirm her membership.</span></p><p><span >Once inside, Travel Buddy reminds her that she can watch In-flight Entertainment while in the executive lounge on her personal electronic device (PED). She debates whether to work or watch a movie, but decides that she wants to start watching a movie.</span></p><p><span ><img alt=\"Candice enjoying airline-provided entertainment on her P.E.D.\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"35e6e6cf-00e3-4b92-9d00-a44954c20209\" src=\"/images/Candice-9.png\" /></span></p><h2>Screen 9, Candice is Directed to Her Flight and Continues Watching Her Movie</h2><p><span >Fifteen minutes before she is supposed to board, Travel Buddy notifies Candice that it is time to pack up and head to the gate (Travel Buddy knows the gate is a 7-minute walk from the executive lounge).</span></p><p><span >Candice gets on the flight, and once she is seated, she resumes watching the movie she had started in the lounge. The flight attendant notices on her Cabin Crew PED that Candice is a top-tier customer, and likes to have a bowl of warm mixed nuts and a champagne when she sits down. So, the flight attendant offers Candice these items. </span></p><p><span >At this point, Candice's experience is that the process has been not only smooth, but truly enjoyable and relaxing. Without a doubt, she will choose this airline again in the future.</span></p><p><span >Candice receives a notification based on he preferences that there are items on sale in the in-flight catalog. She pauses the movie, and decides to shop online. She finds a set of cool Solar LED lights for her backyard and purchases them on board. </span></p><p>The benefit here is that Candice is satisfied, and is presented with relevant offers. The result is that the airline earns a revenue share of all merchandise sold from their site. Airlines have paper-thin margins today, and increasing merchandising opportunities is a key way to increase margins.</p><p><img alt=\"Candice sitting on the plane, receives a free meal, and shops online\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"477bacc1-aa2b-4032-9248-721d4abd08ff\" src=\"/images/Candice-10.png\" /></p><h2>Screen 10, Buddy Provides Social and Behavioral Recommendations. Candice Buys a Gift</h2><p>Travel Buddy knows Candice is traveling to New York, and that it's her friend Janice's birthday. Travel Buddy also highlights items from Janice's Amazon Wishlist, so Candice purchases a gift, which is waiting for her at the gate when she lands.</p><p>Candice does a little work while sitting on the plane, then at 30 minutes before the flight ends, she decides to watch another movie. She knows that she will not finish it, but knows she will be able to watch it later that evening at her hotel, because she was granted digital rights to the movie for 24 hours when she ordered it on her PED.</p><p><img alt=\"Social recommendations to purchase gift for friend Janice\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a67f2d0c-0c39-44f0-ac58-88deb57e8cf2\" src=\"/images/Candice-11.png\" /></p><h2>Screen 11, In NY, Travel Buddy Guides Candice at Each Step and Notifies Her When She Has an Upcoming Travel Activity</h2><p>Once the plane lands, Candice is notified where to pick up the gift she purchased for her friend Janice, where her baggage claim is, where to pick up her rental car, and where her hotel is. Travel Buddy also notifies Janice whenever she has an upcoming travel activity, such as leaving for the airport 3 hours, 15 minutes before her flight, so she can return her car, and be on time for her flight.</p><p>Travel Buddy becomes her indispensable single travel concierge that increases her loyalty, as measured in customer satisfaction scores, and her delight throughout her travel experience.</p><p><img alt=\"Candice Arrives.

        "body": "<p>When working with startups, UX leaders need to bring tools to differentiate, while recognizing funding constraints. With this consumer vacation site, the goal was to increase engagement and conversion. The challenge was an infrastructure that didn’t support modern interactions. Rather than deliver sub-standard designs, we helped drive business process and engineering changes required to implement each enhancement. <span style=\"line-height:1.5\">Some of these changes included upgrading to a different back-end technology, and implementing some client-side capabilities to improve site performance and page load times. By creating a more modern and responsive site, we were able to</span> promote user engagement, which increased demand. It also increased satisfaction for property owners, enabling us to increase the number of properties. Of course, funding constraints typically exist in startups, so many changes have had to wait.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Original versus New Site Design\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"3f69902e-9a5e-4702-a237-55e01c287eb2\" src=\"/images/AOV-Old-n-New.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Original Site Design Versus Initial Redesign</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p> </p><p>We also drove technology changes to ensure users can view and interact with key information and page attributes almost instantly after a search, while the remainder of the content on the page continues to load. In the end, our work resulted in a roadmap of capabilities and innovations that will take several releases to implement, and which leverage leading design concepts and patterns.</p><p>Among changes were a new logo, which we curated for under $1,000, a brand and design refresh, and several mechanisms for driving engagement. </p><p>Among these mechanisms for driving engagement were:<ul><li>High quality photography, which can increase engagemen by as much as 4x</li><li>Create an inspiring design that is easy to use, and meets the deeper needs of the users booking properties.</li><li>Support the four major intents users have when coming to such a site:<ul><li class=\"p3\">Find a property in a pre-determined region</li><li>Seek inspiration to find the right vacation destination (see the Future Home Page option later).</li><li>Find a way to help the Chief Household Officer make a choice of venue that everybody (across families) would love. The fact is that when choosing vacation rental homes, often more than one family travels together, and making everyone happy can be a chore.</li><li>Find special deals</li></ul></li><li>Enable direct booking of properties, rather than simply sending an email and waiting for a reply.</li><li>Enable users to enter the address of a destination, and find properties in that vicinity.</li><li>For mobile users, to identify where they are, and identify and book properties with availability for the current night.</li><li>Create the equivalent of favorites and wish lists, so travelers can both track inspirations and share them socially.</li></ul></p><p>As part of this process, we compared other sites, both direct competitors and related travel sites, to understand what they do well, and what we could do to improve the consumer site, both from a supply (property owner) and demand (traveler) perspective. We also conducted primary and secondary research to understand the personas for the site and product. In the end, we identified that by far the larger percentage of visitors was women, and specifically women who fit into the category of Chief Household Officer. That is, they are in charge of a household, and for booking vacation plans not only for their family, but often for multiple families at once.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Alternate Design Tested Worse with Female Users\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"9e7d0b22-7eae-4c97-b707-7b1d41c074e9\" src=\"/images/AOV-Alternate.png\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: Alternate Design, which Tested Worse with Female Users</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p> </p><p>It turns out that most male users preferred the white space and smaller images found in Figure 2. However, most females preferred an image that covered most, if not all of the Home page, with content over the top of the image. Thus, over time, the company intends to include even higher quality photography, and even leverage multiple images, with movement and sound, embedded within CSS. Figure 3 highlights the intended new page, though we are recommending a full-page picture.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Intended redesign over time\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"29b7cd4b-11cc-4c6f-8200-df3af1903163\" src=\"/images/AOV-Home-Just-Top.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 3: Eventual New Home Page</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p>While the current site is a significant improvement over the previous version of the site, any site—consumer or otherwise—requires constant tweaking to improve. In fact, data has shown that instituting a multivariate testing (a/b testing or bucket testing) infrastructure can help increase engagement and conversion by 500%. In the end, the Engineering team will implement such an infrastructure, but first must continue to implement “do or die” features. Such an experimentation framework is critical for consumer sites, and I look forward to working with a great group of people in this company going forward to help implement many of the enhancements that come out of our engagement.</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Enabling Customers to Explore the World\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"2e206255-0867-4a86-9a00-0dd97edbcf2d\" src=\"/images/Explore_page_1.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 4: Inceasing Engagement for Users Who Want to Explore the World (Initial Concept)</figcaption></figure></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Comparing Search Results Pages- Old Versus New</h2><p>Here is an example of the old versus the new Search Results (Geography) pages:</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Old Versus New Search Results Page for a City or Region\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"67e31ca7-037a-4e90-b100-bc2013ec3ca0\" src=\"/images/AOV-Geo-Page-old-n-new.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 5: New Search Results (Geo) Pages</figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Comparing Property Pages- Old Versus New</h2><p>Here is an example of the individual property pages from the old versus the new site:</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Property Page Before and After Redesign\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"1b8b3a9c-3dc0-4ebc-8605-5bc920e26bf8\" src=\"/images/AOV-Old-n-new-Property-Page.png\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 6: Old Versus New Property Pages</figcaption></figure></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Photo View Results Page</h2><p>Here is an example of the new Photo view results, which shows the Information bar pinned to top of page, so that it is never lost when the user scrolls down the page:</p><p><figure><img alt=\"Photo view results with Information Bar pinned to top of page\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"6aee1de0-36f9-4cde-9800-cfc7cc85edca\" src=\"/images/Photo-View-Results.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" /><figcaption>Figure 7: Search Results Page in Photo (Card) View </figcaption></figure></p><p></p><p> </p><h2>Key Results</h2><p>Since the redesign, the site has increased its supply of properties, and acquired another 400,000 through property management companies. In addition, based on my recommendations, they are merging with a company that has a true real-time booking engine, and a distribution API, which enables this large supply of properties to be distributed and booked on any travel site, not just this consumer site. Of course, this one consumer site functions as a reference implementation to prove the real-time booking and distribution capabilities.</p><p>This article has shown only a subset of pages for this redesign. To discuss other pages, including Wish List pages and more, reach out and let’s have a conversation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>In the article “Lean UX: Reduce Learning from Six Months to Two Weeks,” I highlighted how great UX leaders know how to research and build concepts fast, solicit feedback, and iterate. They create presentation-layer code in days or a couple weeks. They then gather insights from users in usability studies (both performance- and preference-based data), and get market-based feedback to ensure customers will buy the product. If the product has challenges, they iterate. By moving fast from concept to code, they reduce the learning cycle from months to days, and know they have a great product from the start, one that users love and are willing to buy. This article takes the wireframe vignettes (story) presented in the article “Wireframes Tell a Story” and presents the functional prototype that my team produced, based on cross-functional input and feedback. The screens in this article became the basis of the final product. We took this presentation-layer code (<em>View</em> layer in the MVC model) and connected it to the business layer (<em>Controller</em> layer), then to the back-end. Users and customers could interact with what felt like a real application. As such, we were able to both validate the concept in the marketplace, and validate the usability of our design throughout the design and development process.</p><p><img alt=\"Flow diagram, sketch, wireframe, and final app\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"4d3a2134-7f44-4e71-a804-4ad70194c099\" src=\"/images/Flow-to-Prototype_0.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p>When done right, producing the View layer takes 10% of the work required to build the full application. Let’s take the analogy of a spear: The presentation (view) layer is the tip. It looks good, but without the handle (the application back-end) to give it weight, balance, and the right trajectory, the tip makes no real impact. You need both the tip and the handle, and both require skill. One challenge with UX is that product managers and engineers often confuse the lesser amount of work with lower complexity and therefore a reduced skill set. Because they understand features and technology, they over-simplify the process of defining the experience outcome upfront, and over-think the features and technology too early in the process. But, as Steve Jobs said “You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology.” The view or presentation-layer represents the final experience. Start with this result, with the intended experience outcome, map it through the presentation layer, <em>then</em> define technology and features to support the result. That is what we did with in the following example.</p><h2>The Application</h2><p>In this example, the screens represent exactly what a user would see in the final application.</p><h2>Visual Design</h2><p>Let’s start with the visual design—we had several goals; take a look at the screen below as you review these goals:</p><ul><li>Content is king: Remove any lines or extraneous elements that are not absolutely essential to helping the user find the element they need to interact with to perform a task. If there is an extra line, dot, color, grouping, or element, remove it.</li><li>Honest and simple: Remove unnecessary skewmorphisms, because these draw the eye to the style, rather than content.</li><li>Flat: Even back in 2012 when we developed this application, when Apple and Microsoft were still using gradients, we implemented a flat design. Fundamentally, gradients draw the eye to themselves unnecessarily.</li><li>Clear visual hierarchy: It is clear to the user when they first encounter this page what the key elements are, and where to look for what kinds of information. Moreover, the hierarchy, or relationship between elements is clear, and group elements that are all part of a larger context.</li><li>Progressively build to complexity where required: There are times when workflows are inherently complex, even after you simplify them as much as possible. When this happens, start simple, and add elements over time, so the user gets used to the baseline, and then sees only the necessary incremental elements. Cognitively, start with what the user knows, and build on that.</li><li>Maintain context. Ensure the user is always oriented, even if they have multiple sessions and multiple tasks going at once. If the user looks away and comes back, make it easy to see the point of focus within two seconds.</li><li>White-labelable: Make sure the colors and logos in this application can be easily replaced with other brands, so we could sell this application to multiple customers, and easily customize it to each.</li></ul><p><p></p><img alt=\"Home Screen\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"079ab92c-4d64-437f-8b00-b28d180704b9\" src=\"/images/ResGUI-1.png\" /></p><p> </p><h2>Application flow</h2><p>The following sections highlight the application flow for a single scenario- a customer Judy Meyer, who is a Gold Tier customer with FlyAway Airlines. Judy has different needs when she flies for business versus when she flies with her family for leisure. The system allows the agent to select the appropriate profile quickly, which auto-populates the appropriate fields with the correct parameters. Of course, the agent can still change these parameters if the passenger chooses.</p><h2>Judy Meyer Calls the Reservation Center</h2><p>In the screen above, you can see that the reservation’s agent is on the phone with a customer, Ms Judy Meyer.</p><h2>Reservation Agent Selects Profile and Destination</h2><p>In the following screen, the res agent (Chris Childress) has selected Leisure Travel Preferences for Ms Meyer, who indicated that she wants to take a family trip (with her husband and daughter). Because the system stores both business and leisure travel preferences, when the agent selected Leisure, it automatically selected the class of service “Premium Economy” and because their dates are typically a bit more flexible, the system will check for flights two days before and two days after the target dates, to provide flexibility. Had Ms Meyer said she was on a business trip, her preferences would have given her Business Class by default, and would only find flights on the exact date provided, because her business schedule is typically inflexible. These were Ms Meyer’s preferences, and they are changeable in preferences. They could also be overridden by the agent booking the trip, but tended to speed the process of booking.</p><p>Note also that the agent selected Round-trip, a starting point of PHL, and a destination of LHR, plus 2 adults and one child.</p><p><img alt=\"Searching for flight\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"171fe38b-e34b-4b3f-8e05-5c770c76b463\" src=\"/images/ResGUI-2.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p> </p><h2>Search Results Screen</h2><p>In the Search Results screen, we changed it to show the top breadcrumb <em>Search Travel </em>highlighted. We also wanted to retain the user’s context:</p><ul><li>We summarized their original search parameters inside of a collapsed container, which they could change</li><li>We showed each result inside of a container that could be minimized if the agent wanted to see an overview of multiple legs of a trip at once (especially useful on complex itineraries)</li></ul><p>The screen shows all options for each leg of the trip. Note that if the agent hovered over any class of service for a trip, an overlay appeared, showing the price.</p><p><img alt=\"Search Results\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"d4453f97-e1bc-454b-aa04-4e9951bf70aa\" src=\"/images/ResGUI-3.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p> </p><h2>Selecting a Flight and Having it Show Up in Order Summary</h2><p>In this screen, the agent selects a flight, and the system shows the total cost of the items selected thus far.</p><p><img alt=\"Selecting a flight\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"8c616a7e-2c36-4063-ae27-39381ed05b61\" src=\"/images/ResGUI-4.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p> </p><h2>Selecting a Return Flight</h2><p>In this screen, the agent selects the Return flight, and that shows up in the Order Summary on the right. This follows the initial concept that screens become more complex one item at a time as the user progresses through the work flow. In addition, the left of the screen, shows all active orders, with the current order highlighted. In terms of visual hierarchy, you can see that Chris Childress is waiting on Ms Judy Meyer, and is creating a trip with booking reference REQYYD.</p><p><img alt=\"Selecting Return Flight\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"59fb3b31-26be-4a7e-9804-4c5eafe54d9f\" src=\"/images/ResGUI-5.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p> </p><h2>Confirming Passengers and Seating</h2><p>In the previous screen, the agent had clicked either Book, or clicked directly on the Customers breadcrumb, either of which would take them to this screen.</p><p>In this screen, Chris Childress verifies that the people traveling with Judy are Jack Meyer and Rebeccah Meyer. Because they were listed in her Leisure profile, they were automatically added. Of course, Chris could remove either or both with a single click, or add a different passenger. She clicks either the Next button at the bottom of the screen, or the Services breadcrumb at the top.</p><p><img alt=\"Adding Passengers\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"0da10cb1-89fb-4b16-8651-8158f6bf8121\" src=\"/images/ResGUI-6.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p> </p><h2>Adding a Tablet Rental</h2><p>Because airlines need to earn incremental revenue through add-on merchandise and services, Chris asks Judy if she wants to rent a tablet on which they have games for kids, along with music and the latest movies, for her daughter. Judy agrees, so Chris adds a tablet rental for both the outbound and return flight.  The agent, Chris, then clicks Next to go to the Payment screen.</p><p><img alt=\"Adding a service- a tablet\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a5063042-4442-455e-9f03-3d3c36a931a8\" src=\"/images/ResGUI-9.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p> </p><h2>Paying for the Flight</h2><p>The Payment screen appears. It shows the itinerary and the costs, and shows the default of Judy Meyer paying.</p><p><img alt=\"Paying for flight\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"be515bc0-19fa-4a72-a800-e6c921a742a0\" src=\"/images/ResGUI-10.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p> </p><h2>Adding a Form of Payment</h2><p>Judy wants to pay $5,000 with her personal MasterCard, so the system shows on the right that there is still a balance of $6,062.</p><p><img alt=\"Adding form of payment\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"46d4490c-00e6-47f4-bb17-23a5479ebfa4\" src=\"/images/ResGUI-11.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p> </p><h2>Adding a Payer</h2><p>Judy decides to add her husband Jack as one payer, and to use his Visa to pay for the remaining $6,062, leaving an amount of $0 remaining. Note that this all seems simple, but is much, much more complex than this today. There is no way to split out costs and payment within any existing system today.</p><p><img alt=\"Adding a payer\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"8cc75eb1-7281-4a12-9200-d2a5f34e5585\" src=\"/images/ResGUI-12.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p> </p><h2>Reviewing and Submitting the Itinerary</h2><p>In this screen, the agent reviews the itinerary with Ms Meyer, and enables Ms Meyer to receive her itinerary and receipts via email, US Mail, or (if she were at the airport) printed and handed to her. Ms Meyer prefers to receive her documents via email, so the agent clicks Email, and clicks Print and Send.</p><p><img alt=\"Reviewing and Submitting An Itinerary\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"d258c4c6-c208-4cb4-b11f-315978383b77\" src=\"/images/ResGUI-13.png\" class=\"align-left\" /></p><p> </p><h2>Summary</h2><p>The screens in this scenario represent one workflow, but of course the prototype itself supported many possible scenarios and workflows. Once we had the basic prototype complete, we were able to validate and iterate it based on user feedback to ensure that it was both usable, and that it delighted its users.
